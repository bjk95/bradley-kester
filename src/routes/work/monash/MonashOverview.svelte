		<p>
			Realistically, I spent most of my undergraduate days focusing on my education through worldly experience, a.k.a traveling. 	
		</p>
		<p>
			In the time I spent at in the country I start out studying Psychology before trying out Law because I thought Harvey Spectre was the man, 
			before finally settling on economics mainly because I loved travel and figured I couldn't practice law outside of Australia. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Outside of class, I was a member of Business School's student society and went on exchange to Prato in Italy, perhaps becoming too much of an expert in Italian grape juice.
