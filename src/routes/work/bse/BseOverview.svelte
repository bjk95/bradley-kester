			I completed my master's degree at the Barcelona School of Economics. 
			After traveling to Barcelona a couple of years before it was my dream to go back and life in what felt like the most alive city in the world.
		</p>
		<p>
			Translated to English the actual degree is a Master's Degree in Specialized Economic Analysis, specializing in International Trade, Finance and Develop. Yeah - a mouth-full, I know.
			In human language, not economic nerd words we studied econometrics (i.e. stats) and applied it to how nations get rich or stay poor, and how they interact with each other.
		</p>
		<p>
			For anyone still interested I got an 8 as my median grade which is the Spanish equivalent to an Australian 'High Distinction' or an 'A' in most places around the world.
