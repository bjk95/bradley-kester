			Weeve solves the problem of combining your, and your organisation's data with AI, becoming your second brain.
		</p>
		<p>
			I founded Weeve out of frustration AI lacks both my personal knowledge and the ability act. 
			By enriching large language models (LLMs) with personal and organisational knowledge they become the oracle to answer our questions
			and by enabling them to act using agents they become the assistants to streamline our work.
